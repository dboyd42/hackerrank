# Hacker Rank Code

This repository holds all of my Hacker Rank code.  I follow a 4 step process in
solving these challenges.

## About

My focus will be programming in Python 3.  Otherwise, I'll dabble in Bash,
Regex, and C++.

## Solving Challenges

1. Research the challenge's subject.
2. Write the code to pass all test cases.
3. Optimize the code by looking at other programmer's code in the Discussion tab.
4. [Optional] Post an explanation in the Discussion's tab.
