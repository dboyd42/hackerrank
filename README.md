# Hacker Rank Code

## About

This repository holds all of my Hacker Rank code. My focus will be programming in Python 3.  Otherwise, I'll dabble in Bash,
Regex, and C++.

I follow a 4 step process in solving these challenges.

## Solving Challenges

1. Research the challenge's subject.
2. Write the code to pass all test cases.
3. Optimize the code by looking at other programmer's code in the Discussion tab.
4. [Optional] Post an explanation in the Discussion's tab.
